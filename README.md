Project created for the LO43 UV during A19 Semester

The main objective is to recreate a game based on the 7 Wonders game with our school skin.

As you can see, the project isn't finished due to the massive time we spent on the server part. All the functions are perfectly working.
The rules are basically the same as the real game but with little ajustement to make it easier.
